                </h3>
                <p div class = "para">My name is Tino and welcome to my Git-Page/portfolio. I am a recent graduate Computer Science Major
                (Software Engineering Concerntration) from the University of Manitoba. My program was very challenging. As much as it was challenging
                   it wa still just mentally stimulating
                 enough to keep me interested in what I was doing. At times I would work on a problem and encounter brick walls and feel like 
                 a solution was not viable. 
                    <br>
                   During my first years I had no idea what Computer Science was all about, (very evident with me feeling stuck and 
                 just giving up) but as I dove deeper into my program I realized that it's all about solving problems and bottlenecks. 
                 The program tested every aspect of my resolve to complete it and through it I became a more resilient thinker.
                The process involved a great deal of independent research, requiring initiative, self-motivation and learning a wide range of 
                skills and technologies. </p>
                
                <p div class = "para"> It consisted of courses like Database Systems, Analysis of Algorithms, Web Technologies, Software Engineering,
                 Networking, Specification and design of Graphical User Interface, Distributed Systems, Technical Communication and a whole load of Mathematics..lol
                The program assisted me to gain basic but essential knowledge in the multiple fields of Computer Science.
                Adapting to various work cultures, identifying plus resolving bottlenecks and prioritizing have been striking features of 
                my working style. In addition to the above, I strongly believe in learning and sharing my knowledge with my colleagues.
                “Knowledge parted is knowledge gained” has been my motto in life. I am always keen to learn and I am sharp at identifying 
                and solving problems. When I am not stuck typing away code behind a screen you can find me playing around with various 
                digital audio workstations and producing music or in a park somewhere enjoying the outdoors.

                The very first language I ever learned was Python. Not Html, not CSS. Believe it or not but, before my first year in
                 university, I had never programmed in my WHOLE entire life. Not a single line of code. It was all the way uphill, a challenge for me and I 
                 struggled a lot to learn the basic syntax as I had never programmed anything in my whole entire life. I painstakingly 
                 learned the syntax and libraries from the ground up. It was a slow process but soon enough I was actually writing code.
                I eventually became good at writing sensible python code but before I knew it I ran into new hurdles.

               The very next 
                 semester we had to use Java. Transitioning from python to Java was at first and initially strange for me. I was not used to explicitly 
                declaring types and the flow appeared unusually structured and very peculiar to me. Soon enough, I learned how to write good
                code in Java too and progressed further onto C and C++ and so on. Up until today, I am still learning different languages
                and technologies in order to diversify my portfolio and fluency. I can, however, say I am strongest in Java, Python, and C++.
                These are my go-to languages. My program was a traditional Computer Science program hence there was not that much 
                on Front-End Web technologies. In order to balance that out, I have been making an effort to teach myself some front
                end frameworks

            This was a Software Engineering 2 class project whereby we had to build a fully working mobile and Web app, linked to the 
            same server. I teamed up with 8 other students to deliver a minimum viable, fully functional app. The app is pretty much a dungeons
            and dragons character customization suite, with a database/ login and character update properties. An EC-2 instance with node.js was used
            to implement the database together with SQL. For the front end we used React and React-native for the purposes of time saving. React-native
            was chose for it's build once, deploy everywhere feature which allows for both I-OS and Android apps so share the same code base.

            This was a me just clearly having fun and demonstrating my knowledge of computer graphics and physics. This is a simple script built 
            in processing (P3D). Initially it was a Graphics 1 project which was meant to simulate a simple 3D world with different camera angles
            and also allowing for movement and camera movement. I am guessing one bored Saturday I got bored and got too carried away and turned it
            into an entire politics gallery. The gallery features some prominent figures in politics today like Trump, Trudeau, Obama, Clinton, you
            know, the regulars. It allows for a first person movement and 3 different camera angles.

            Not much work was put in here.

            This was a mock up site which emphasised on HCI and placment of components. As you go through the web app you will notice that it'safe
            not really fleshed out. It's meant to be a mock up with a focus on asthetics and heuristics. It's basically a front-end stub without
            any back-end attached to it, hence it does not process any request. It was built with HTML+CSS+ Javascript and Bootstrap

            <p div class = "para">
          This was a Software Engineering 1 project where I teamed up with 4 other brilliant colleagues to build a fully functional android app. I found
          myself taking the lead role in this project and took up the position of scrum master and repo-manager. This project is what flamed my
          apsirations to particularly pursue Software Engineering. Having the oppourtunity to work with a well concerted and orchestrated team is 
          always a good feeling.The app allows for users to view theaters within their city and book tickets and seats in advance. It also allows users to buy concessions
          and rate movies before and after watching them. It was built with Java and Android Studio.
